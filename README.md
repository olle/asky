Asky!
=====

_NOTE: during the initial experimental phase, we're trying out different
technologies and languages, to find a perfect fit. We're also doing a type
of [readme driven development] process, so many described features may not
yet be implemented._

Asky is a single-purpose [Query/Response] server, aimed at being really easy
to deploy and run, built from the ground up to truly be cloud-native.
